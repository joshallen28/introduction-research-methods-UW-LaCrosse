# introduction-research-methods-UW-LaCrosse
This is a gentle introduction to graphing in Stata and R for Dr. LaPlant's Research Methods class.
The materials in this repo are 100% meant to be copy and pasted to help you learn Stata and get you introduced to R. For more practice with visualizing data and coding please
download the iris dataset. I highly reccomend that you check out [Andrew Heiss's excellent materials](https://datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com/) for more on data viz in R and general best practices!

# The Data

The data used for the in class example is in the `penguins.csv` file and is the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins). Please use the `iris.csv` file to practice.


# The Code
- The `coding example live.do` file is the `.do` file that I coded in the lecture that Dr. LaPlant recorded.
- The `graphing-in-stata-basic.do` file is cleaner and has some solutions that you might find helpful.
- The `getting-started-in-R.Rmd` and `getting-started-in-R.html` are essentially replications of the  `.do` files with a fun example from [this github repo} (https://gist.github.com/andrewheiss/8e514355d75aac1a7d6b91a67b896f20)
