# introduction-research-methods-UW-LaCrosse
This is a gentle introduction to graphing in Stata and R for Dr. LaPlant's Research Methods class.
The materials in this repo are 100% meant to be copy and pasted to help you learn Stata and get you introduced to R. For more practice with visualizing data and coding please
download the iris dataset. I highly reccomend that you check out https://datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com/ for more on data viz in R and general best practices!

# The Data

The data used for the in class example is in the `penguins.csv` file and is the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins). Please use the `iris.csv` file to practice.
