# Purpose
This is a gentle introduction to graphing in Stata and R for Dr. LaPlant's Research Methods class.
The materials in this repo are 100% meant to be copy and pasted to help you learn Stata and get you introduced to R. For more practice with visualizing data and coding please
download the iris dataset. 

# Who this is for

The files in this repo are primarily for people who are just getting started in Stata and R. If you are just getting started perfect! If you are looking for more advanced Stata data vizualization I highly reccomend checking out [this excellent resource](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide) by [Asjad Naqvi](https://twitter.com/AsjadNaqvi) or for stuff in R I highly reccomend that you check out [Andrew Heiss's excellent materials](https://datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com/) for more on data viz in R and general best practices!


# The Data

The data used for the in class example is in the `penguins.csv` file from the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins). Please use the `iris.csv` file for more practice!


# The Code
- The `coding example live.do` file is the `.do` file that I coded in the lecture that Dr. LaPlant recorded.
- The `graphing-in-stata-basic.do` file is cleaner and has some solutions that you might find helpful.
- The `getting-started-in-R.Rmd` and `getting-started-in-R.html` are essentially replications of the  `.do` files with a fun example from [this repo](https://gist.github.com/andrewheiss/8e514355d75aac1a7d6b91a67b896f20)
